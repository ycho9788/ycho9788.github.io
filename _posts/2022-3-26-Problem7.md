1. Let A be an array of size n containing n distinct numbers. If i < j and A[i] > A[j], then the
pair (i, j) is called an inversion in A. Suppose that each element of A is chosen uniformly at random from
the range 1 through n. Use indicator random variables to compute the expected number of inversions.

2. Some lotteries award enormous prizes to people who correctly choose a set of seven numbers
from 1 to 60. What is the probability of winning such a lottery?

3. A sequence of 16 bits is generated uniformly at random. What is the probability that at least
one of these bits is 0?
Hint: Consider using the complement of an event.

4. Suppose that you want to write a routine that will return a 0 with probability 1/2 and a 1 with
probability 1/2. At your disposal is a procedure called Biased Random, that returns either 0 or 1. It returns
0 with some probability p and returns 1 with probability 1 âˆ’p, where 0 < p < 1. Unfortunately you do
not know what p is. Give an algorithm that uses Biased Random as a subroutine, and returns an unbiased
answer. Your algorithm should return 0 with probability 1/2 and return 1 with probability 1/2. Explain
why your algorithm is correct.
