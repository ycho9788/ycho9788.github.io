1. Consider the following recurrence:
a(base k)=
{0 ,if k = 0}
{a(base k−1) + 3k + 1 if k > 0}
(a) Write out the first six terms of the recurrence.
(b) Make a guess for the explicit formula for a (base n).
(c) Prove your guess is correct using induction.

2. Use the Master Theorem to solve the recurrence
W (n) = 4W(n/2)+n

3. Find Largest Index
(a) Write the pseudocode for a divide-and-conquer algorithm that finds an index for the largest
element in a list of n numbers.

(b) What will be your algorithm’s output for lists with several elements of largest value?

(c) Set up a recurrence relation for the number of key comparisons made by your algorithm.

(d) Solve the recurrence relation set up in the previous part.
